# Session: 2026-02-16

## Summary
Set up local development environment and automated git sync workflow.

## Accomplished

1. **SSH Key Setup**
   - Generated ed25519 key on Mac
   - Added to GitHub

2. **Repository Clone**
   - Cloned fork to ~/AI Projects/nanobot
   - Set up upstream remote

3. **Branch Strategy**
   - `main` → pure upstream mirror
   - `my-modifications` → custom changes
   - `stable` → deployable version
   - Set `my-modifications` as default branch

4. **GitHub Action**
   - Created `.github/workflows/sync-upstream.yml`
   - Runs daily at 6 AM UTC
   - Auto-syncs main with upstream
   - Rebases my-modifications onto main
   - Updates stable on success
   - Manual trigger available

5. **Documentation Structure**
   - Created CLAUDE.md (merged generated + custom)
   - Created docs/architecture.md
   - Created docs/operations.md
   - Created docs/todo.md

## Key Decisions

- Use rebase strategy (not merge) to keep clean history
- Workflow lives on my-modifications branch
- stable branch only updates on successful rebase (always deployable)

## Next Session

- Apply documentation files to repo
- Continue with Reddit skill implementation
- Set up global ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md for personal preferences
